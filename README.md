The heart disease detection model leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health metrics and risk factors. This model tries to improve itâ€™s Accuracy and efficiency by the using the machine learning algorithm - Random forest. Model focuses on dealing with heart diseases timely which reduces cost due to early detection of the disease.
